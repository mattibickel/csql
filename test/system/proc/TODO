1.process 1 does insert and sleep (no commit), kill thread 1.
.check if the inserted row is seen in the database.
2.Do 1 with index, check for index  nodes after that.
3.Do the above for update
5.Do the above for delete
7.Do the above for mixed insert, update and delete
8.Do 7 with index
9.proc 1 doing insert and sleep, kill proc1 with SIGINT, SIGTERM.
.check if the tuple is seen.check log whether it did cleanup.
10.proc 1 doing insert continously, kill proc1 with SIGINT, SIGTERM.
.check if the tuple is seen.check log whether it did cleanup.


Fault:
1.process 1 does insert and sleeps after inserting in chunk and before it inserts into hash index. kill the process 
.check if the inserted row is seen. check the number of index nodes.
2.process 1 does insert and sleeps after inserting in chunk and idx1 and before it inserts into idx2. kill the process 
.check if the inserted row is seen. check the number of index nodes in both idx
3.Do 1 for update
4.Do 2 for update
5.Do 1 for delete
6.Do 2 for delete
7.For all mutexes in system, take mutex and sleep. kill the proc.
.call apis which acquire that mutex and check if it works (Not now)
