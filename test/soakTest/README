This is a soak test suit where csqlserver will run forever.
The size of USERDB is 1073741824 bytes. (1GB);

Set kernel.shmmax=1610612736  (1.5GB)
Table of the following schema should be created in csql and TDB

CREATE TABLE soakTable(f1 smallint, f2 int, f3 bigint, f4 char(28), primary key(f2));

Size of each record will be 64kB.
The total number of pages = 131068.
One page will have 127 records.
Hence there can be (131068 * 127) = 16645636 records in the database.

There will be following processes that will be working on the 't1' table doing vvarious operations.

1. csqlInsert: (SqlApi Script)
   This process will be inserting a record every 200 ms picking a random integer the value between 1 and 16645636.

2. odbcInsert: (odbc script)
   This process will be inserting a record every 200 ms picking a random integer between 1 and 100000.

3. jdbcDelete: (jdbc script)
   This process will delete first record fetched in the table every 200 ms.
