This module runs SQLGwTest cases for with and without parameterized statements.

All the ksh scripts first create the table in target database.
The table so created is cached into the csql database cache.
The binary executable is run under this script corresponding to the script.
once executable is run the results are compared with the expected file.
The cached table is unloaded.

VALGRIND can also be run on each of the executable for LEAK Checks by setting
an environmental variable VALGRIND to true and run the script.

$ export VALGRIND=true
$ testXXX.ksh

An output file testXXX.ksh.valgr is created for leak reference.
