Introduction 
------------
CSQL is a fast, multi-threaded SQL main memory database engine. It is a free software, licensed with the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE http://www.gnu.org/
It aids in the development of high performance, fault-resilent applications requiring concurrent access to the shared data.

Platforms Supported
-------------------
Linux and Solaris

Compilers Supported
-------------------
g++ in linux,
CC in solaris

Compiling the source
--------------------
Go to the root directory and enter the following commands.

$./configure --prefix=`pwd`/install
$make
$make install

This will create "install" directory under the current directory and places all the executables created in bin directory and libraries in lib directory.

Available Documentation
-----------------------
1.User Manual is available under the docs directory
2.HTML API Reference for DB API under the docs/html directory
3.DB API example programs under the examples directory

Generating API Reference
------------------------
Go to the root directory and enter
$doxygen

This will create "docs/html" directory under which API Reference html files are stored. Refer index.html in that directory.

Starting the Server
-------------------
You should find csqlserver executable under the bin directory of the installation.

$./csqlserver

This starts the server and creates the database file.

Shutting down the Server
------------------------
Pressing Ctrl-C on the terminal where csqlserver is running, is safe and will stop the server gracefully by removing the database file.
