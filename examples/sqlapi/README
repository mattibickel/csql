This contains an example program that demonstates usage of sqlapi interface.

What it does?
-------------
It creates table t1 with two fields f1 integer and f2 string.
Creates index on f1 field of t1 table.
Inserts 100 rows into the table t1, 1 insert per transaction
select rows with f1 value 1 to 10 and displays
Drop the table

How to compile
--------------
1. Make a copy of this directory in a writable area
2. Edit the Makefile and set the CPlus variable to point to the C++
   compiler on your system.
3. Set the CSQL_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable to point to your installation 
   directory or change INCL and LIB variable in the Makefile to point to
   installation directory
4. Use the make command to compile
	$make

How to run
----------
1. Set the CSQL_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to absolute path of csql.conf file.
	$export CSQL_CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/csql.conf
2. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to csql library path
	$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CSQL_INSTALL_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3. Run the executable created by make
	$./sqlapiexample
